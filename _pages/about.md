Welcome to my page! I focus on a wide variety of topics, with particular focus on natural language processing and possible applications on economic questions. 
As an expansion of this, I also focus work computational work on large databases. 
Images, text, survey data and large tax databases are some of the few that I have worked on in the past. 
Consider looking at my blog page that houses blog posts that summarize some of the useful outcomes of all the projects and papers that I work on. 
The navbar contains links to my publications, projects and repositories. 
Feeling anxious to reach out for collaboration or employment? 
Please see my cv page and consider whether my skills and experience match your requirements. 


For fun, I am an avid gamer ([bg3](https://baldursgate3.game) and [helldivers2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helldivers_2) are my favourite at the moment), a lover of padel and golf, and a new student in Muay Thai. 
I also run a lot. 
Here is a tiktok link to quite a funny new zealand muay thai influencer: 
[teepmuaythai](https://www.tiktok.com/@teepmuaythai/video/7352469993725971713?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7353998440697103878)
I cook a lot, and some of my most renowned meals are gourmet boerewors rolls and various mediterranean disches. 
I also like 3D printing things like this to help me in my dungeons and dragons campaing: [dice box](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2964977) and a nice [randomizer](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2511974)


For the world of social, I look at reddit for inspiration; here are some of my favourite communities:
For programming inspiration I look at [coding](https://www.reddit.com/r/coding/s/Hdkrhj3C5E) and [python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/s/j7BjzSeMR4). For some economic content, the [economics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/s/AAURWJdU5k) and [economicHistory](https://www.reddit.com/r/EconomicHistory/s/CZK4Mj4Hu9) subreddits are great. Ofcourse, one of my favourite subreddits is [datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/s/R6OO2Ev5c1) as it helped me a lot when starting out with data science topics. 
Some light meal Keynesian content I enjoy is [economicsexplained](https://youtube.com/@EconomicsExplained?si=Gwq3durvyYCOuFO6) on youtube.
